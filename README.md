## Hello, this is the first localhost commit

Frontend setup....

From your terminal, run:

```
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

This will take a minute or two, but once that's done, you should be able to run the following command:

```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will start your project on `localhost:3000`


Backend setup...

I am using intellj, so I setup the pom.xml with the corresponding build run.
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```


## WILL add more detail later
